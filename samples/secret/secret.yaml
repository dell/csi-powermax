# To create this secret use: kubectl create secret generic powermax-creds -n powermax --from-file=config=./secret.yaml

# List of storage arrays (Required)
# Each storage array must have a primaryEndpoint and backupEndpoint
storageArrays:
  - storageArrayId: "000000000001"
    primaryEndpoint: https://primary-1.unisphe.re:8443
    backupEndpoint: https://backup-1.unisphe.re:8443
    # Optional labels allow for restricting access to arrays based on
    # one or more user defined topology labels. The following example
    # restricts connections for array 000000000002 to only nodes which
    # have both labels. The labels are case sensitive.
    # labels:
    #   topology.kubernetes.io/region: region1
    #   topology.kubernetes.io/zone: zone1
    #
    # Optional parameters can be specified in the secret so that they can
    # be used as defaults when not specified in the storage class.
    # Details on the parameters can be found in the sample storage class files.
    # All values are treated as strings so numeric and boolean values must be quoted.
